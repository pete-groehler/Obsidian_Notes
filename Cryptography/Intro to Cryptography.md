## Algorithms
- Mathematical instructions that ciphers use for encryption.
### Stream Ciphers
- Apply algorithm one bit (character) at a time

### Block Ciphers
- Apply algorithm to chunks (blocks) of characters.

## Keys
- ### Key Space
	Each algorithm has a possible range of numbers that can be used as a key
