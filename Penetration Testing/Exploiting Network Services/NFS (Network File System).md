## What is NFS?
Protocol that allows a system to share directories/files with others on the network (i.e. "Share Drives")
- Accomplished through **Mounts**
- Mount can be accessed with **privilege levels assigned to the files.**

## Enumerating NFS
**nfs-common**
- Important to have package installed on any machine that uses NFS (client or server)
- Includes programs such as: **lockd, statd, showmount, nfsstat, gssd, idmapd, mount.nfs**

## Mounting NFS shares
- Client system needs a directory where all content shared by host server can be accessed.
	- **can be anywhere on your system**
```bash
sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock
```

## Exploiting NFS
- **Root_Squash**
	- Prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access.
		- Remote root users are assigned as **"nfsnobody"** (least local privileges)
	- If root_squash is turned off, could allow creation of SUID binaries.
