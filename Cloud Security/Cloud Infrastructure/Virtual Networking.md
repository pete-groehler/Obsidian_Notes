## Resource Groups
- Resource groups allow engineers to sort related resources into different groups
	- Logical grouping of all resources used for a particular setup
	- Will contain network, firewalls, virtual computers, and other resources.
- **"Bedrock" of Virtual Network

## Virtual Network
- More flexible than physical networks
	- Do not depend upon physical connections.
	- VMs can reside in different data centers but act as if they were wired (> availability)
- Virtual networks are more quickly and easily reconfigured.
- Faster + Easier to implement improved segmentation.
